# Developing Personal Scripts

Personal scripts are "go-to" phrases that you can use and fall back on, especially in tough conversations with awkwardness or discomfort. It is especially useful to create a feeling of being aligned on goals while working collaboratively and productively to achieve them. Personal scripts can also often buy you time during a tough conversation, preventing impulse responses, and promoting well-thought out reactions to the problems at hand.
