# Developing Personal Scripts

Personal scripts are "go-to" phrases that you can use and fall back on, especially in tough conversations that cause awkwardness or discomfort. Personal scripts can often buy you time during a tough conversation, preventing impulsive or reactionary responses, and promoting well-thought-out reactions to situations. Having these types of phrases prepared ahead of time frees up mental capacity to process the situation and determine how you may want to handle it.
