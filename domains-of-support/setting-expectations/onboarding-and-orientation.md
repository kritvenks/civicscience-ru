# Onboarding and Orientation

### <mark style="color:purple;">What is an onboarding toolkit?</mark>

* A lab onboarding toolkit is a set of resources that together:&#x20;
  * Constitutes a process for enabling the assimilation of new lab members (students, postdocs, scientific staff, support staff) into your lab&#x20;
  * Equips new lab members with tailored knowledge, tools, and insight specific to functioning effectively in your environment
* Resources in the toolkit are:
  * Used across different phases from pre-arrival through several months to a year into the new lab member joining the lab
  * A balance between different types of materials, including cheat sheets, checklists, and “FYI” guides that provide background and context that cannot be gleaned simply from a website

### <mark style="color:purple;">Why should you create and use an onboarding toolkit?</mark>

* By equipping new lab members with the knowledge, know-how, and language of your specific lab, the onboarding toolkit can boost their confidence and empower them to see how their role fits within the larger lab group and institution
* It contributes to a culture of inclusion, where the new lab member is readily welcomed into the community before and/or upon arrival
* It encourages expectations to be set early, allowing a new member of the lab to understand the dos and don’ts while becoming informed about lab policies

### <mark style="color:purple;">Who should customize this onboarding toolkit?</mark>

* This is not a static resource; the onboarding toolkit should be evolving, with periodic fact-checks and updates
* Typically, it is most logical for the Principal Investigator (PI) to set the tone for onboarding materials, outlining the general framework as well as the fundamental specifics. This ensures continuity, as most if not all other members of the lab tend to be transient
* It is also important for the PI to share the resources with their group, inviting feedback, suggestions, and additions. Ideally, lab members will have continued access to update resources as needed, refresh their memory, and also be asked to conduct a regular review of the materials as a group

### <mark style="color:purple;">When should you implement this onboarding toolkit?</mark>

* An onboarding toolkit is not a one-time resource, and is instead intended to be utilized across different phases, including pre-arrival, first day/week, and first three months&#x20;
* Suggestions are provided for when each of these resources are most relevant, and it is useful to have an overview of what is available so the new lab member can plan ahead

### <mark style="color:purple;">**How should we implement best practices for onboarding?**</mark>

* Treat this like a directory of contacts, directions, and tasks for getting started
* Recognize that onboarding is a partnership between the new lab member and the lab that they are joining; the lab is responsible for providing information, while the new lab member is responsible for utilizing the information provided
* Open bidirectional communication channels are key
  * Plan when and how to deliver information&#x20;
  * Ask questions when something is unclear
* Make explicit space and time for new lab members to explore new professional relationships, lab norms, and institutional structures
  * Assign a point person or “buddy” from the lab to take the lead on welcoming, introducing, and navigating on the first day
  * Categorize the onboarding resources into their relative priorities and allow the new lab member time to digest the information in the first week
  * Motivate the new lab member to have one-on-one meetings with other lab colleagues and personnel within the institution’s departments in the first month
  * Encourage participation in community-building and campus activities over the first few months
