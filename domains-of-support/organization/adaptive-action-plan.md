# Adaptive Action Plan

{% hint style="info" %}
**“Adaptive Action Planning”** is a technique used in employee onboarding, project management, and other processes, where work is divided into 1–2 week **cycles of planning, action, and revision**.&#x20;

For example, in onboarding, one form of structuring these cycles is the “30-60-90 Plan,” where goals are laid out for the new employee at the 30-day mark, the 60-day mark, and the 90-day mark, with a commitment from their manager to revisit the progress and adjust course as needed at each of these milestones.

## <mark style="color:purple;">An Adaptive Action Plan for Mentored Research</mark>

An action plan structured with iteration and revision can fit well with the plans often made for scientific experiments. We suggest using a rapid version of this for planning to mentor a short-term mentee. It involves establishing milestones of success at regular intervals, e.g., every two weeks, with weekly meetings on progress, thereby creating time for frequent feedback and revision toward the milestones and larger project goals (e.g., results for their poster, completion of a defined body of work to which they have some ownership, the potential for autonomy, etc.).

This type of explicit planning can substantially improve communication and expose differences in expectations between the mentor and mentee. If the mentee can see from the beginning where you hope that they will be at the end, they are better able to take responsibility, and build independence toward these goals. They may also be better able to ask for help since they will at least know what to ask about. It can also be a very helpful learning experience as a mentor to reflect at the end of the summer on what goals were reasonable to achieve in this timeframe — this can help with future project planning, grant writing, and mentorship as you continue in your scientific career!

For example, summer students’ final poster presentations provide a way to structure the components of their research into familiar parts of the research process. Not all students have _final_ results for the poster and that is okay; however, the student’s work should fit into a story and not just be disconnected or repetitive tasks supporting your research agenda.

It is also helpful to think about the nature of the research project you would like to develop for your mentee. For example, will the project involve a set of linear steps where one leads into the other? Or will the project involve a set of steps that can be done in parallel, or overlap in some way? Or perhaps there is a little bit of both… Whatever the project format, incorporating time for mistakes/redos, assessment and feedback, as well as knowing approximately how much time should be invested at each step along the way, will keep things running smooth (well, at least as smooth as possible).&#x20;

## <mark style="color:purple;">Proposed Adaptive Action Plan Skeletons</mark>

For example, for the Rockefeller SSRP, mentors have 7-weeks with their mentees, so we propose breaking the time up into 2-week chunks (aka the 2-week, 4-week, and 6-week products) and a 7th wrap-up week to produce the final output, wrap up loose ends, and clean up. _Informally, we call this the “2-4-6” plan_. Two different formats for outlining a project in this structure are featured below as examples:

**Example of 7th-week wrap-up notes:**

* Make sure DNA samples in the freezer are clearly labeled or thrown out.
* Clean up all kombucha jars from your experiments, leaving the mother culture to continue to grow.
* Photograph and then throw out all kombucha plates or other leftovers from experiments or data collected.
* Make sure any samples left in the lab for continued study are clearly documented in your lab notebook with future instructions.
