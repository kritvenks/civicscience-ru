# Adaptive Action Plan

### <mark style="color:purple;">**Why Use Adaptive Action Planning?**</mark>

* This type of explicit planning can substantially improve communication and expose differences in expectations between the mentor and mentee.&#x20;
* If the mentee can see from the beginning where you hope that they will be at the end, they are better able to take responsibility, and build independence toward these goals.&#x20;
* They may also be better able to ask for help since they will at least know what to ask about.&#x20;
* It can also be a very helpful learning experience as a mentor to reflect at the end of the summer on what goals were reasonable to achieve in this timeframe — this can help with future project planning, grant writing, and mentorship as you continue in your scientific career!

### <mark style="color:purple;">What is Adaptive Action Planning?</mark>

**“Adaptive Action Planning”** is a technique used in employee onboarding, project management, and other processes, where work is divided into short **cycles of planning, action, and revision.**&#x20;

In a mentored scientific research context, creating an adaptive action plan for any new project and mentor-mentee partnership provides a framework to set goals, execute tasks, assess progress, and iterate to achieve results.

An adaptive action plan - a roadmap structured with iteration and revision - can fit well with the planning of scientific experiments and projects spanning different lengths of time.

One form of structuring adaptive action planning cycles is using the “30-60-90” method, where goals are laid out for the mentee at the 30-day mark, the 60-day mark, and the 90-day mark, with a commitment from their mentor to revisit the progress and adjust course as needed at each of these milestones.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
A "30-60-90" days method might be appropriate when mentees are new graduate students or postdocs, who have some experience with scientific research, but who are new to specific laboratory, collaboration, or project.
{% endhint %}

Adaptive action planning involves establishing milestones of success at regular intervals, e.g., every two weeks, with weekly meetings on progress, thereby creating time for frequent feedback and revision toward the milestones and larger project goals (e.g., results for their poster, completion of a defined body of work to which they have some ownership, the potential for autonomy, etc.).

{% hint style="info" %}
For short-term mentees, such as high school/undergraduate summer students  or graduate rotation students, we suggest using a rapid version of the 30-60-90, for example a "2-4-8" week method.
{% endhint %}

### <mark style="color:purple;">Considering the Project/Experience Type</mark>

It is important to think about the nature of the research project you would like to develop for your mentee. For example, will the project involve a set of linear steps where one leads into the other? Or will the project involve a set of steps that can be done in parallel, or overlap in some way? Or perhaps there is a little bit of both. Whatever the project format, incorporating time for mistakes/redos, assessment and feedback, as well as knowing approximately how much time should be invested at each step along the way, will keep things running smooth (well, at least as smooth as possible).&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">OK, Give Me an Example Context...</mark>

For example, presenting a final poster, such as at a research symposium, provides a way for mentees to structure the components of their research into familiar parts of the research process. Not all students have _final_ results for the poster and that is okay; however, the student’s work should fit into a story and not just be disconnected or repetitive tasks supporting your research agenda.

This approach could also apply to a presentation at the end of a mentee's research stint, either to a small group of peers in the research or internship program, or to the entire laboratory group.For example, for the Rockefeller SSRP, mentors have 7-weeks with their mentees, so we propose breaking the time up into 2-week chunks (aka the 2-week, 4-week, and 6-week products) and a 7th wrap-up week to produce the final output, wrap up loose ends, and clean up. _Informally, we call this the “2-4-6” plan_. Two different formats for outlining a project in this structure are featured below as examples:

**Example of 7th-week wrap-up notes:**

* Make sure DNA samples in the freezer are clearly labeled or thrown out.
* Clean up all kombucha jars from your experiments, leaving the mother culture to continue to grow.
* Photograph and then throw out all kombucha plates or other leftovers from experiments or data collected.
* Make sure any samples left in the lab for continued study are clearly documented in your lab notebook with future instructions.
