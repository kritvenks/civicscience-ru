# Culture of Wellness: Considering Multiple Dimensions

_Estimated Reading Time: 10 minutes_

Wellness has many facets: physical, emotional/mental, financial, environmental, intellectual, social, occupational, spiritual, and more. In considering your personal wellness in the context of your belonging within a collaborative community such as a laboratory or university, it is important to keep tabs on all these facets, reflecting on where you stand at any given point in time, and being proactive with how you respond to restore equilibrium. The framework shared in this resource explicitly rejects academia's grind culture and firmly establishes a practice of personal wellness centered on the philosophy that this is the key step toward community wellness.
