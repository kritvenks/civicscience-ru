# Vision and Values

## Our Vision

<mark style="color:purple;">Our guiding belief</mark> is that **science is a human endeavor.**

<mark style="color:purple;">Our vision</mark> is to **create and deliver customizable resources** that will **equitably recenter knowledge access structures** and **allow** **rigorous science to be accessed by all individuals** across career stages, irrespective of their background. We hope that by **designing clearly accessible pillars of support**, individual scientists are **empowered to bring their whole selves to work,** embracing rather than tolerating differences **** in a more cohesive, inclusive workplace.

<mark style="color:purple;">Our goal</mark> is to **provide a core set of scaffolds across several key domains** that will together serve as an **easily employable, holistic, and practical infrastructure for laboratories.** We aim to **enable individual laboratories to tailor the design and implementation** of these scaffolds as applicable to their group context.&#x20;

## Our Values

* Drive with empathy.
* Design for functionality.
* Lead with openness.
* Support with data.
