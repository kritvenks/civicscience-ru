# Land Acknowledgement

We believe that historical awareness of Indigenous exclusion and erasure is critically important, and we are committed to working to overcome their effects in our own educational institutions.

As we begin this work, we encourage you to reflect on the history and context of your surroundings.

[https://native-land.ca/](https://native-land.ca/) is one of many resources that enables you to input your location and learn about its Native context and signficance, a first step towards acknowledging the complex history of Indigenous exclusion.&#x20;

#### We would like to acknowledge that the land The Rockefeller University was built on is a part of ancestral Lenape homelands. We recognize the longstanding significance of these lands for Lenape nations past and present. We are also conscious that New York City has the largest urban Native population in the United States.&#x20;
