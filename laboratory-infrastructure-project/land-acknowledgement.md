# Land Acknowledgement

{% hint style="success" %}
As a first step towards acknowledging the complex history of Indigenous exclusion, a context within which we all exist, we encourage you to reflect on the history of your surroundings.&#x20;

[https://native-land.ca/](https://native-land.ca/) is one of many resources that enables you to input your location and learn about its Native context and significance.&#x20;

Below we provide our land acknowledgment, which you may use as an example to create your own.

_<mark style="color:purple;">We would like to acknowledge that the land The Rockefeller University was built on is a part of ancestral Lenape homelands. We recognize the longstanding significance of these lands for Lenape nations past and present. We are also conscious that New York City has the largest urban Native population in the United States.</mark>_&#x20;
