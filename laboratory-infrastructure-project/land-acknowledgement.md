# Land Acknowledgement

{% hint style="info" %}
As we begin this work, we encourage you to reflect on the history and context of your surroundings. [https://native-land.ca/](https://native-land.ca/) is one of many resources that enables you to input your location and learn about its Native context and significance. We suggest this as a first step towards acknowledging the complex history of Indigenous exclusion. Below, you will find our acknowledgment, which you may use as an example to adapt.&#x20;

### _<mark style="color:purple;">We would like to acknowledge that the land The Rockefeller University was built on is a part of ancestral Lenape homelands. We recognize the longstanding significance of these lands for Lenape nations past and present. We are also conscious that New York City has the largest urban Native population in the United States.</mark>_&#x20;
