# Community Guidelines

{% hint style="info" %}
In engaging with the materials provided to construct a custom infrastructure for/within your laboratory, we encourage you to develop and consider a set of community values and norms, which sets the tone for the culture of your work environment. We provide our community norms and values, which we recommend adapting or using as an example.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

*   <mark style="color:purple;">**YOU BELONG HERE**</mark>&#x20;

    Your perspectives and participation are valued. We want what you have to offer!
*   <mark style="color:purple;">**MAKE SPACE FOR MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES**</mark>&#x20;

    No one knows everything, but together we know a lot.
*   <mark style="color:purple;">**LET THIS WORK CHANGE YOU**</mark>&#x20;

    Be open to questioning and revising your existing understandings and beliefs.
*   <mark style="color:purple;">**BE WILLING TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;"></mark>&#x20;

    Learning and progress come from challenging our beliefs, ideas, and the ways we’ve done things—but not challenging your humanity, the humanity of others, or jeopardizing safety.
*   <mark style="color:purple;">**CRITIQUE IDEAS AND CONCEPTS, NOT PEOPLE**</mark>&#x20;

    Including yourself. We can disagree while still building relationships with each other.
*   <mark style="color:purple;">**MAKE SPACE FOR EMOTION**</mark>&#x20;

    We are each personally and emotionally invested in our work. Science work is emotional work. We can hold space for this when these emotions surface while we are together.
*   <mark style="color:purple;">**SHARE THE SPACE**</mark>&#x20;

    Focus on the dynamics of power and privilege. Pauses and silence are okay. What do you need to step up or step back?
*   <mark style="color:purple;">**ACCEPT NON-CLOSURE**</mark>&#x20;

    This work is an ongoing journey to understand ourselves, the experiences of those around us, and our world.
*   <mark style="color:purple;">**BE PRESENT AND PARTICIPATE FULLY**</mark>&#x20;

    Set aside distraction, e.g., your phone.
