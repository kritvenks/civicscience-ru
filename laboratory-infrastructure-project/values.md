{% hint style="success" %}
As you engage with the tools provided here to co-create an infrastructure of scientific support, we encourage you to begin with a reflection of your personal values.&#x20;

Below we provide a guided exercise, which can be used as a personal reflection tool. You may also consider using this exercise as part of a larger conversation between laboratory members to encourage sharing and creating a culture of accountability.
